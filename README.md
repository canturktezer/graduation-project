Text-to-text translaiton: Users have the ability to input text in their preferred language, and the system will translate their messages to the desired language of other users.

Speech-to-text translation: Users can speak in one language, and the system will transcribe their speech into text, making it easier to communicate across language barriers.

Support for multiple languages: The system initially supports five languages but has expanded to include a total of 15 languages.

Integration with Google Cloud: The project utilizes Google Cloud's translation API technology, which offers advanced neural machine translation for accurate and efficient translations.

Technologies Used

The Translation and Interpretation System incorporates the following technologies:

JavaScript: The back-end of the system is developed using JavaScript.

Google Cloud: The project heavily relies on Google Cloud's translation API technology for seamless and accurate translations.
